# Nitty-gritty (An Hexagonal Architecture Study)

Based on "Designing Hexagonal Architecture with Java" book, by Davi Vieira.

I took the same domain problem proposed in the book (with slight modifications).
And implemented in Typescript using the NestJS framework.

This is not a transpilation from Java to Typescript of the book's implementation.
I try to tweak some parts to suit my taste and needs, and evaluate some ideas.
